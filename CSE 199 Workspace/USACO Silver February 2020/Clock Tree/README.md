# Information about Clock Tree
### Summarized concepts
  - You should realize that O(N^2) is acceptable, even though there's an O(N) solution, because the standards are low for silver.
  - Minimum spanning tree
  - Get rid of leaf nodes first
  - DFS or BFS (DFS recommended)

### Explanation
If you do enough test cases, you may end up realizing that there's an O(N) solution that's possible for this question. I'll leave a few images here to reference to see how 
I figured it out, but it took a long time to figure that out, so I would still stick with an O(N^2) solution. The images are listed below:
