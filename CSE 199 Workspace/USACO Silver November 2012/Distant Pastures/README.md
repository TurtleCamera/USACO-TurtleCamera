### Summarized concepts
  - Matrices
  - Greedy algorithm
      - Dijkstra's algorithm

### Explanation
This problem isn't that complicated either, although I do want to mention that N is really small (at most 30), so we can brute force this problem. With that in mind, I just thought of converting the entire matrix of
