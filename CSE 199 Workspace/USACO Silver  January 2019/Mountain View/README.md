### Summarized concepts
  - N is large, so the algorithm should be at least as good as O(N * log(N))
  - Visualize the problem in a different way: don't think of it as peaks. Convert the problem to an interval problem
      - Famous interval scheduling problem (greedy version)
      - Sort by start times, but choose the left-most end time, such that the interval isn't covered by any of the other intervals.
  - Merge sort.
      - compareTo function.
