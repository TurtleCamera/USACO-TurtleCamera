# Information about Grass Planting
### Summarized concepts
  - Graphs
      - Minimum spanning tree (not really the main focus).
      - Adjacent nodes.
      - Don't actually build the tree

### Explanation
This problem doesn't really have much to it. The key part is the bolded part of this sentence:  
  
If the same grass type is planted in two adjacent fields (directly connected by a pathway) __or even two nearly-adjacent fields__ (both directly connected to a common field with pathways), then the cows will complain about lack of variety in their dining options."
